## üìö Introduction

`grepcon` is a RESTapi to get the favicon from urls. This project was especially made for [nura-pwa](https://github.com/nura-vault/nura-pwa) to eventually replace the unofficial google api for displaying favicons from websites. The google api sadly doesn't work for many websites and therefore is not sutible for my usecase.


## üìù Getting started

Using `grepcon` is fairly easy. Firstly, clone the repository and use Docker to build and run the application

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

Afterwards you can access the api via following RESTapi

```shell
curl https://localhost:8080/api/v1/favicon?url{URL}?fallback={FALLBACK_URL}
```

After invoking the endpoint, an array with urls to the different favicons will be returned. Example:

```
[
    "https://www.google.com/favicon.ico"
]
```

### Current Limitations

Currently `grepcon` is not able to comply with redirects and will therefore break on trying to resolve an url which will be redirected. In the future I intend to resolve this issue.
